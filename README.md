# Fidelity Diamond Hands
This repo is currently split up into two directories, `firefox` and `chrome`. These names are descriptive of the browsers they support. If you are using another browser you can [look here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Build_a_cross_browser_extension) to evaluate compatibility. `Opera` should be able to use the chrome directory, `Edge` probably won't work unless they have compatibility with `chrome` namespace. `IE11` is just a terrible browser in general, you should really consider `firefox`.

## Installing

1. **Firefox**: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fidelity-diamond-hands/
1. **Chrome**: *pending*
    - If you would still like to use this extension you can do so by doing the following.
    1. Use terminal and navigate to where you want the files for this extension
    1. `git clone https://github.com/lukeingalls/diamond-hands-extension`
    1. Open up `chrome` and load the extension manually by following [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/#manifest).

No other browsers are being supported officially.

## New Features

If you want to request a feature you can do that by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/lukeingalls/diamond-hands-extension/issues). If you want to increase the likelihood of having your feature actually produced you can support the project by following the details under the support section. In the unlikely event this is taken seriously I will first focus on making this extension more elegantly cross-browser compatible.

You can also just do the feature you want and then submit a PR. That would be your best bet.
